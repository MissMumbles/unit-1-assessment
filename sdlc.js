// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const Requirements = "Second step, somewhat part of planning. Defining what the software is supposed to do, and what is required for a software to function, and resources needed to make it. "
const Design = " Third step, models the way a softwar apllication will work. Such as UI and Platfrom"
const Implementation = "Fourth step, actually writing the program. "
const TestingIntegration= "Running test to make sure the software runs as expected and fix any bugs that are found."
const Maintain = "Any enhancements or necessary bug fixes made to sofwar after launch. "
